**Qoctor** is an online service that enables you to get the prescriptions that you regularly use without needing to book a doctor’s appointment. The service also provides medical certificates with just a few clicks and a Skype chat, and ensures that all your ordered prescription medication is delivered to your doorstep. 

*Qoctor began as an idea to offer patients a choice of obtaining some of the basic things that they needed online without having to visit a doctor’s office.* 

The service initially offered only medical certificates but quickly realized that it could also deal with basic medical issues that patients are expected to see a doctor for even if they do not require a face to face consultation. These basic medical issues include embarrassing ones such as sexually transmitted diseases, erectile dysfunction, or having a case of head lice. 

>  To obtain a medical certificate, you will be asked a few questions before you can book some chat time on Skype with a doctor, who will confirm that you are sick but do not require further medical intervention. The medical certificate will cost you $19.99, while referrals to other specialists also cost $19.99. A request for a prescription involves the doctor offering you information about the condition you are suffering from and then giving you options on the medication that you would like to purchase or get a subscription for. \
> \
> The doctor will hereafter ask you a series of questions to check if the medication is appropriate for you, then the prescription is sent to you via Australia post. The cost of a paper prescription is $19.99 for the doctor’s fee including Registered Post delivery services, but Express Post costs an additional $4.99. The same charges also apply to delivery of medication. \
> \
> Ultimately the service expects you to answer questions and to choose your medication correctly, and this requires that you trust yourself to take care of your own health. 
>
> **This online service is unlike others in the market because it expects you to make the decisions about your treatment instead of the doctor performing a diagnosis and making an appropriate decision. In as much as it offers patient flexibility and choice, this makes it a tricky service because it may be misused to obtain medication  not unsuitable for the user regarding their circumstance. Furthermore, the service is different because it initially uses a questionnaire to ask medical questions and only sets up a Skype video consultation with a doctor when necessary.**

> ###### [](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.qoctor.com.au/nDqasrV)This means that you do not have direct and quick access to a doctor at all times the way other online services operate. Even though the questionnaire enables you to provide pertinent information as you desire, a physical or virtual doctor would nevertheless have the ability to ask the right questions that can generate a clearer diagnosis.

> # Pros and cons \
> \
> Pros  \
> \
> •	The service offers convenience for busy individuals who have already had the necessary health checks and confirmed that they are fine. As such, Qoctor offers them flexibility. 
>
> •	It offers patient autonomy and choice so that patients do not have to seek out a doctor for something simple, for example contraceptive pills. \
>
> •	Patient data is securely encrypted to prevent hacking and theft.
>
> \*\*Cons\*\* 
> •	There is no personalized doctor involvement required for an individual to order prescriptions, and this could lead to misdiagnosis. 
>
> •	Patient safety is also at risk because the doctors are prescribing medication for a patient that they do not have sufficient or prior information about. 
>
> •	The doctors do not have a means of confirming the information provided by the patients, so the risk of misdiagnosis is high. 
>
> •	It is possible for an individual to easily order for medication without ever being diagnosed, by falsely answering a few questions. 
>
> •	There are limited patient-doctor interactions and this could prevent formation of a meaningful and ongoing relationship to enhance the quality of treatment in the long term. 
>
> •	No Medicare rebates are available for this service.
