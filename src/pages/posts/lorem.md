**Qoctor** is an online service that enables you to get the prescriptions that you regularly use without needing to book a doctor’s appointment. The service also provides medical certificates with just a few clicks and a Skype chat, and ensures that all your ordered prescription medication is delivered to your doorstep. 

*Qoctor began as an idea to offer patients a choice of obtaining some of the basic things that they needed online without having to visit a doctor’s office.* 

The service initially offered only medical certificates but quickly realized that it could also deal with basic medical issues that patients are expected to see a doctor for even if they do not require a face to face consultation. These basic medical issues include embarrassing ones such as sexually transmitted diseases, erectile dysfunction, or having a case of head lice. 

>  To obtain a medical certificate, you will be asked a few questions before you can book some chat time on Skype with a doctor, who will confirm that you are sick but do not require further medical intervention. The medical certificate will cost you $19.99, while referrals to other specialists also cost $19.99. A request for a prescription involves the doctor offering you information about the condition you are suffering from and then giving you options on the medication that you would like to purchase or get a subscription for. \
> \
> The doctor will hereafter ask you a series of questions to check if the medication is appropriate for you, then the prescription is sent to you via Australia post. The cost of a paper prescription is $19.99 for the doctor’s fee including Registered Post delivery services, but Express Post costs an additional $4.99. The same charges also apply to delivery of medication. \
> \
> Ultimately the service expects you to answer questions and to choose your medication correctly, and this requires that you trust yourself to take care of your own health. \

In as much as it offers patient flexibility and choice, this makes it a tricky service because it may be misused to obtain medication  not unsuitable for the user regarding their circumstance. Furthermore, the service is different because it initially uses a questionnaire to ask medical questions and only sets up a Skype video consultation with a doctor when necessary.**

> ###### [](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.qoctor.com.au/nDqasrV)This means that you do not have direct and quick access to a doctor at all times the way other online services operate. Even though the questionnaire enables you to provide pertinent information as you desire, a physical or virtual doctor would nevertheless have the ability to ask the right questions that can generate a clearer diagnosis.

> ###### Pros and cons
>
> \
> **Pros**  \
> \
> •	The service offers convenience for busy individuals who have already had the necessary health checks and confirmed that they are fine. As such, Qoctor offers them flexibility. 
>
> •	It offers patient autonomy and choice so that patients do not have to seek out a doctor for something simple, for example contraceptive pills. 
>
> •	Patient data is securely encrypted to prevent hacking and theft.
>
> **Cons**
> •	There is no personalized doctor involvement required for an individual to order prescriptions, and this could lead to misdiagnosis. 
>
> •	Patient safety is also at risk because the doctors are prescribing medication for a patient that they do not have sufficient or prior information about. 
>
> •	The doctors do not have a means of confirming the information provided by the patients, so the risk of misdiagnosis is high. 
>
> •	It is possible for an individual to easily order for medication without ever being diagnosed, by falsely answering a few questions. 
>
> •	There are limited patient-doctor interactions and this could prevent formation of a meaningful and ongoing relationship to enhance the quality of treatment in the long term. 
>
> •	No Medicare rebates are available for this service. \

*“You’re probably going to end up treating people who might not have seen a doctor otherwise,” she said. “At $20 per consult it’s a very low-cost service from the patient’s perspective.”*

*The key to treating any patient, whether online or in person, is taking a comprehensive history.*

*“Medical wisdom has always said that around 80 per cent of diagnoses can be made based on history alone,” she said.*

*“A well trained doctor recognises a patient that requires a physical exam. It’s about us making sure that the information we get from the patient is comprehensive. As doctors there is always concern about risk \[of misdiagnosis], we deal with it every day. Practising online medicine poses different challenges, but taking good patient history is at the core of good medicine."*

*Dr Boylan said Qoctor’s mission was to work with the Australian Medical Association and GPs to provide an online hub for patients “to get the same treatment that they would inside a clinic”. - [source ](https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/health/health-news/calling-in-sick-and-getting-away-with-it-now-costs-only-20/news-story/782580284e1dce5d3a6ffb4a403ec21b)*
